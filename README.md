# ProjectFileSearch
This project is to search millions record and get the required outputs. 
First program task.  We need to do some comparison operation for 4 Millions of records, for that I request you to write a small Java program to handle it. Below is the requirements.
1.	The input file will be a comma separated file and you need to read that file and start counting based on the input. I’ve attached the sample file.
2.	The CSV structure is description, MID, given_first_name, received_first_name, given_last_name, received_last_name,
3.	Each line in that file indicate one record
4.	I need you to find how many “Not found” records are present in this file and all the MID has to be in MID.txt file
5.	I need you to find how many “First name not found” records are present in that file and copy all the given and received first name in firstname.csv file
6.	I need you to find how many “Last name not found” records are present in that file
7.	How many “match” records in that file
